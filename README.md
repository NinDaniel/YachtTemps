# YachtTemps

Yacht templates for various applications ranging from Bitwarden and other useful selfhosted tools, services, and sites to a wide assortment of gaming servers ready to be deployed for friends!
This is meant to be a private repo for my own use but you're more than welcome to use it if you find yourself in the same use case.

If you don't see a game server you'd like, please feel free to submit a pull request for it and it will be added!
